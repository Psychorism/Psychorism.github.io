title: Introducing Psychorism
---

Psychorism is a project group of psychology majors in Seoul National University. 


### What We have done

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:

* **Linear Algebra** : Coding the Matrix (Season 1, 2)
* **Bayesian Statistics** : PsyBayes


### Goals 

* To unite with psychologists nationwide/worldwide


Thanks!
